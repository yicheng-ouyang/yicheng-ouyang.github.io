<!-- # Gomoku AI -->

This project was for my Artificial Intelligence course, placing me in the Top 10 among all Computer Science majors in my grade in a competitive round-robin Gomoku AI tournament. I developed the core AI algorithm using Python 3 and then encapsulated it into a user-friendly executable game with a graphical user interface.
