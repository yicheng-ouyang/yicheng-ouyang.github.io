A multiplayer Monopoly game revolving around the campus life in SUSTech. The events were close to daily lives of the students and the 3D graphics was modelled after the real-life campus.

After entering your name, you can get to the lobby which shows the list of rooms available. When 3 people are in the same room, the game will start. In the game you can work, study, buy item card, take bus... Do whatever you can to make your campus life wonderful. After 4 years of campus life (40 rounds in game), the game will make a comprehensive evaluation on every player's performance, the one who gets the highest score wins.

Collaborated with HuangYuan and WuBohao on this project. I was responsible for the entire game client's coding.
